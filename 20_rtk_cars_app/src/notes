Video 327 thinking about derived state

Redux store Design

1. Identify what state exists in the app
2. Identify how that state changes over time
3. Group together common pieces of state
4. Create a slice for each group

What state do we need
name - string
cost - number
searchTerm - string
cars - array of objects {id, name, cost}

//Note - these two are not states we really need
totalCost - number
matchedCars - ???

Derived State - values that we can calculate using existing state. (this is a concept not an actual thing)
So totalCost is derived by using the cars Array and adding up the cost of each car object.
For matchedCars, we can use the name piece of state and cars array and see if they are matching.

video 328 - thinking about redux design

how is the state changing over time?
change name
change cost
change search change
add car
remove car

with this list, we can come up with then names we will use
changeName
changeCost
changeSearchTGerm
addCar
removeCar

Group together common pieces of state
state related to adding cars 
name
cost

state releated to the list of cars
searchTerm
cars - []

create a slice for each group

state related to adding cars -> form slice
starte related to list of cars -> cars slice
